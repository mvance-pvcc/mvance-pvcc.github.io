    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3";>Networking Classifications</td>
			<td>LAN</td>
			<td>LAN normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.</td>
    </tr>

			<td>MAN</td>
			<td>A MAN is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>WAN</td>
			<td>WAN links machines over a greater distance—perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.</td>
		</tr>

    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2";>Network Models</td>
			<td>Bus Network</td>
			<td>Machines communicating directly with each other.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Star Network</td>
			<td>Machines communicating through an intermediary.</td>
		</tr>

    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2";>Protocols</td>
			<td>CSMA/CD Ethernet</td>
			<td>This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CSMA/CA WIFI</td>
			<td>Protocols defined in IEEE 802.11</td>
		</tr>
		
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="5";>Combining Networks</td>
			<td>Repeater</td>
			<td>A device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bridge</td>
			<td>Similar to, but more complex than, a repeater. Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection. Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Switch</td>
			<td>A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two. Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Router</td>
			<td>The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Gateway</td>
			<td>The “point” at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="3";>Client/Server Model</td>
			<td>Peer-to-Peer (P2P)</td>
			<td>The peer-to-peer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Distributed System</td>
			<td>Consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cloud Computing</td>
			<td>Whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.</td>
		</tr>
		
	<tr>
        <td rowspan="3";>Internet Addressing</td>
			<td>Tier 1</td>
			<td>Very high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tier 2</td>
			<td>Tier-2 ISPs tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tier 3</td>
			<td>Essentially an independent Internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses.</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="4";>IP Addresses</td>
			<td><a href='https://www.icann.org/'>ICANN</a></td>
			<td>Blocks of consecutively numbered IP addresses are awarded to ISPs by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DNS</td>
			<td>If a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an IP address before transmitting the message. This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Top-Level Domain (TLD)</td>
			<td>As an example, the domain name of Marquette University is mu.edu. Note the suffix following the period. It is used to reflect the domain’s classification, which in this case is “educational,” as indicated by the .edu suffix. These suffixes are called top-level domains.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a href='https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/'>Country Code TLD</a></td>
			<td>In the earliest days of Internet TLDs, there was a default assumption that connected organizations resided in the United States. The Internet quickly grew to include countries all over the world, resulting in the creation of new two-letter TLDs for each specific country.</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="3";>Internet Protocols</td>
			<td>FTP</td>
			<td>An application for listing and copying files across a network implements the file transfer protocol.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HTTP</td>
			<td>Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>SMTP</td>
			<td>A way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="3";>World Wide Web</td>
			<td>URL</td>
			<td>In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Client-Side Activities</td>
			<td>Activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Server-Side Activities</td>
			<td>Activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="4";>Internet Four-Layer Software</td>
			<td>Application Layer</td>
			<td>The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Transport Layer</td>
			<td>The transport layer adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the message’s destination. Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Network Layer</td>
			<td>It is the network layer’s job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet’s path through the Internet.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Link Layer</td>
			<td>The link layer has the responsibility of transferring the packet. Thus, the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="3";>Internet is:</td>
			<td>Packet-Switching Network</td>
			<td>A packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Fault Tolerant</td>
			<td>Routing on the Internet is fault tolerant and redundant.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Redundant</td>
			<td>The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</td>
		</tr>

	<tr>
        <td rowspan="7";>Cybersecurity</td>
			<td>Malware</td>
			<td>Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.</td>
    </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Virus</td>
			<td>A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine. Then, when the “host” program is executed, the virus is also executed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Worm</td>
			<td>A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Trojan Horse</td>
			<td>A Trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim. Once in the computer, however, the Trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Spyware</td>
			<td>Software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Phishing</td>
			<td>A technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DDoS Attack</td>
			<td>Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a subclass of denial of service (DoS) attacks. A DDoS attack involves multiple connected online devices, collectively known as a botnet, which are used to overwhelm a target website with fake traffic.</td>
		</tr>

        <td rowspan="6";>Protection</td>
			<td>Public Key Encryption</td>
			<td>An encryption method that is widely used because of the enhanced security associated with its use.</td>
