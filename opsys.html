	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Operating System</td>
		<td style= 'width: 800px'>The software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.</td>	
	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Job Queue</td>
		<td>A list of tasks to be carried out in turn by an operating system.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>FIFO</td>
		<td>First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a valuation method in which the assets produced or acquired first are sold, used, or disposed of first.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Interactive Processing</td>
		<td>In a computer system, the process of interacting directly with a program and/or data for immediately modifying, retrieving and/or displaying information. This is usually done on a computer screen.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Time-Sharing Multiprocessing</td>
		<td>Time Sharing is the logical extension of multiprogramming, in this time sharing Operating system many users/processes are allocated with computer resources in respective time slots.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Application Software</td>
		<td>Application software consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine’s utilization.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>System Software</td>
		<td>System software performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Utility Software</td>
		<td>Utility software consists of sofware units that extend the capabilities of the operating system.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
		<td>These systems allow users to issue commands by using one of several common input devices.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Shell</td>
		<td>Older user interfaces, called shells, communicated with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Kernel</td>
		<td>An operating system's kernel contains those software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Device Driver</td>
		<td>Software units that communicate with the controllers to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>File Manager</td>
		<td>Software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Memory Manager</td>
		<td>Still another component of an operating system’s kernel is the memory manager, which is charged with the task of coordinating the machine’s use of main memory.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Virtual Memory</td>
		<td>Still another component of an operating system’s kernel is the memory manager, which is charged with the task of coordinating the machine’s use of main memory.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Boot Strapping</td>
		<td>Bootstrapping is the technique for producing a self-compiling compiler – that is, a compiler (or assembler) written in the source programming language that it intends to compile.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>ROM</td>
		<td>Read-only memory, or ROM, is a type of computer storage containing non-volatile, permanent data that, normally, can only be read, not written to.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Deadlock</td>
		<td>When two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Spooling</td>
		<td>To spool (which stands for "simultaneous peripheral operations online") a computer document or task list (or "job") is to read it in and store it, usually on a hard disk or larger storage medium so that it can be printed or otherwise processed at a more convenient time.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Super User (or Administrator)</td>
		<td>This person gains highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying him- or herself as the administrator (usually by name and password) during the login procedure. Once this contact is established, the administrator can alter settings within the operating system, modify critical software packages, adjust the privileges granted to other users, and perform a variety of other maintenance activities that are denied normal users.</td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Multi-Factor Authentication</td>
		<td>An electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism: knowledge, possession, and inherence.</td>	
	</tr>
