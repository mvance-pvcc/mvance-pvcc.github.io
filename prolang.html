    <tr>
		<td>Machine Language</td>
		<td>To apply the stored-program concept, CPUs are designed to recognize instructions encoded as bit 
            patterns. This collection of instructions along with the encoding system is called the machine 
            language.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Debugging</td>
        <td>Locating and correcting errors in a program is called debugging the program</td>

        <td>Assembler</td>
        <td>Convert mnemonic expressions into machine language instructions.</td>

        <td>Assembly Language</td>
        <td>A mnemonic system for representing programs is collectively called an assembly language.</td>

        <td>Translates programs expressed in high-level primitives into machine-language programs.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Compiler</td>
        <td>Such a translator was similar to the second-generation assemblers, except that it often had to compile 
            several machine instructions into short sequences to simulate the activity requested by a single high-
            level primitive. Thus, these translation programs were often called compilers.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Interpreter</td>
        <td>Rather than producing a machine-language copy of a program that would be executed later, an interpreter 
            actually executed a program from its high-level form.</td>

        <td>Cross-Platform-Software</td>
        <td>Software that is independent of an operating system’s design as well as the 
            machine’s hardware design and is therefore executable throughout a network.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Natural Language</td>
        <td>Languages (such as English, German, and Latin) that evolved over time without formal grammatical 
            analysis.</td>

            program.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)</td>
        <td>A software system is viewed as a collection of units, called objects, each of which is capable of 
            performing the actions that are immediately related to itself as well as requesting actions of other 
            objects. Together, these objects interact to solve the problem at hand.</td>

            <td>List - Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable and are ordered, changeable, and
