<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The USDA was signed into law by Abraham Lincoln in 1862. In an message addressing congress, Abraham Lincoln 
		called the USDA <em>“The People's Department”</em>. Since then the USDA has grown in size and scope and 
		continues to serve millions of Americans.</p>
	
	

<h2>Recent News</h2>
	<p>On October 27th, 2022 the USDA Secretary unveiled a plan to extend high-speed internet access to rural areas
		 in 24 states and three territories. The plan, named the ReConnect Loan & Grant Program, is to provide $759 million to internet service providers in 
		 areas with download and upload speeds of less than 100 megabits per second (Mbps) and 20 Mbps respectively.
		  These internet service providers must commit to constructing the infrastructure required to meet the 
		  specified speeds in their respective service areas.</p>
	

<h2>Budget</h2>
	<p>The USDA requested a total budget of $209 billion for 2023. $169 billion of the 2023 budget is for mandatory 
		services which USDA is required by law to provide. Mandatory budget allocations include programs such as 
		crop insurance, conservation programs, and commodity trade programs. The remaining $39 billion of the 
		budget is discretionary and is used for programs such as rural development grants, national forest 
		management, wild-land firefighting, and much more.</p>

<h2>Structure & Mission Areas</h2>
	<p>The USDA has a responsibility to provide broad array of of services to millions of Americans.To accomplish 
		this, the USDA has broken its responsibilities into eight mission areas which are covered by a multitude of
		 agencies under the USDA's umbrella. Currently, there are eighteen such agencies.</p>

		policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural 
		development, and related issues with a commitment to delivering equitable and climate smart opportunities 
		that inspire and help America thrive.”</em></p>
